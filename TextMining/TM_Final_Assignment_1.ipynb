[1]: The apparent olive branch -- after a year of mutual threats by US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, and multiple missile tests by Pyongyang, coupled with its most powerful nuclear blast to date -- could help defuse sky-high  [2]: But with the two sides engaged in a war of words there is a long way to go before any negotiations -- let alone a deal. [3]: Here are some questions and answers on the issue. [4]: The US has for years refused to talk unless the North first takes steps towards dismantling its nuclear programme. [5]: But the North has staged six atomic tests and declared itself a full nuclear state after the ICBM test on November 28, rendering the prospect of nuclear disarmament increasingly unrealistic, according to experts. [6]: \\\"We are ready to talk anytime North Korea would like to talk. [7]: We are ready to have the first meeting without preconditions. [8]: Let's just meet,\\\" Tillerson said at a forum in Washington. [9]: William Perry, a former US Defense Secretary who helped broker the 1994 Agreed Framework nuclear deal with the North, said it was \\\"very encouraging news\\\". [10]: \\\"We must find a way to come to the table in order to de-escalate the volatile situation with North Korea,\\\" he tweeted. [11]: What does Donald Trump think? [12]: Trump administration officials have piled pressure on Pyongyang with US-led UN sanctions and talk of a potential pre-emptive attack, with National Security Adviser HR McMaster saying this month the potential for war was \\\"increasing every day\\\". [13]: The president has previously dismissed Tillerson's push for talks with the North, tweeting in October that his top diplomat was \\\"wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man\\\" - his favoured epithet for Kim. [14]: \\\"Save your energy, Rex, we'll do what has to be done!\\\" [15]: he added -- and rumours have swirled in recent weeks that Trump was about to sack him. [16]: Whether Tillerson's words herald a major policy shift by the administration remains to be seen. [17]: White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump's views on the North \\\"have not changed\\\". [18]: The North has long expressed a willingness to talk without preconditions and is likely to respond positively to any such offer, analysts say. [19]: \\\"They have believed that the US would have no choice but to sit down with the North for talks in the end... and they might have been right,\\\" said Chung Sung-Yoon, of the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.\",\n          \"President Trump has responded to players from multiple NFL teams kneeling or locking arms on Sunday, tweeting that taking a knee is not acceptable, and suggested the act of protest will lead to bad ratings for the league?\\uc172 games. [1]: Meanwhile, while one Pittsburgh team did not come out of the locker room for the anthem on Sunday, another has accepted the president's invitation to join him at the White House. [2]: Trump tweeted that the Stanley Cup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins will be joining him at the White House, but did not provide a date. [3]: \\\"Great team!\\\" [4]: he added. [5]: The Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday chose not to participate in the national anthem ceremony at all at Soldier Field in Chicago for their noon game against the Chicago Bears. [6]: Elsewhere, owners from the Atlanta Falcons, Detroit Lions, New York Jets, Miami Dolphins, Philadelphia Eagles and Jacksonville Jaguars have now joined players on the field in solidarity. [7]: One owner, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, criticized Trump, who he has previously called a very good friend, saying he is \\\"deeply disappointed\\\" in the president?\\uc172 comments condemning NFL players who kneel in protest during the national ant [8]: \\\"There is no greater unifier in this country than sports, and unfortunately, nothing more divisive than politics,\\\" Kraft said in a statement tweeted by the Patriots [9]: \\\"I think our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and the importance of working together toward a common goal,\\\" the statement said. [10]: \\\"Our players are intelligent, thoughtful, and care deeply about our community and I support their right to peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is impactful.\\\" [11]: The public disagreement comes only months after the Patriots made a formal visit to the White House in April during which Kraft called Trump a \\\"very good friend.\\\" [12]: Kraft's comments came shortly after Trump early on Sunday morning turned his attention to NFL fans in his feud with the league over players who kneel in protest during the national anthem, saying many people \\\"stay away\\\" from the games \\\"because they  [13]: The president also suggested that if fans refuse to go to games due to the protests, \\\"you will see change fast.\\\" [14]: Trump's tweets Sunday came just a couple of hours before a series of NFL games scheduled for the day begin. [15]: Earlier, on Saturday night, the president slammed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for speaking out against Trump's condemnation of kneeling players and statement that team owners should fire those players. [16]: Goodell is \\\"trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country,\\\" Trump tweeted [17]: \\\"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.\\\" [18]: NFL players across the league and their union -- and even some team officials -- were more direct in their response to Trump's criticism Friday night of the handful of NFL players who have kneeled or sat on the bench during the national anthem perfo [19]: The practice was most famously done by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.\",\n          \"If any doubts remain about the veracity of ESPN anchor Jemele Hill's assessment of Donald Trump, the president spent Friday night and much of Saturday morning lashing out at black athletes-because said attacks play straight to his white nationalist b [1]: On Friday, while stumping in Alabama for GOP senate candidate Luther Strange, Trump diverted from his prepared remarks, as is his wont. [2]: After a lengthy pause, Trump stared grimly into the distance, and then unleashed a winding, unhinged spiel about NFL players who kneeled during the National Anthem. [3]: He asked the assembled crowd, \\\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'get that son of a bitch off the field right now. [4]: He's fired.'\\\" [5]: The audience cheered. [6]: Trump didn't stop there, waxing nostalgic about the NFL of yore, when men-real men-could inflict permanent damage on one another without worrying about those pesky concussive and subconcussive blows to the head and long-term cognitive diseases, sound [7]: \\\"They're ruining the game!\\\" [8]: he whinged. [9]: Trump added that ratings had dropped, partly because fans preferred to watch him, and encouraging anyone who witnesses the free expression of political thought should flee to a preferred safe space and boycott the NFL altogether. [10]: \\\"I guarantee things will stop,\\\" he said. [11]: \\\"Just pick up and leave. [12]: Pick up and leave. [13]: Not the same game anymore, anyway.\\\" [14]: Trump's anti-NFL comments in Huntsville were just the beginning. [15]: On Saturday morning, shortly following a Fox & Friends segment on the Golden State Warriors' star, Stephen Curry. [16]: Specifically, Trump did not fancy Curry's announcement that he had no desire to be feted by the White House, and so Trump tweeted that he never wanted Curry and the rest of those mean ol' world champion Golden State Warriors to come to his party any [17]: Granted, as LeBron James helpfully pointed out, Curry wasn't \\\"hesitating.\\\" [18]: He said outright that he had no intention of serving as Trump's grinning prop. [19]: Also, the insult \\\"bum\\\" has been dragged back into the lexicon, which is nice, given that it will probably irk Trump as much as any other (accurate) label.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id_event\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          4,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"article_bias\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

[1]: The apparent olive branch -- after a year of mutual threats by US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, and multiple missile tests by Pyongyang, coupled with its most powerful nuclear blast to date -- could help defuse sky-high  [2]: But with the two sides engaged in a war of words there is a long way to go before any negotiations -- let alone a deal. [3]: Here are some questions and answers on the issue. [4]: The US has for years refused to talk unless the North first takes steps towards dismantling its nuclear programme. [5]: But the North has staged six atomic tests and declared itself a full nuclear state after the ICBM test on November 28, rendering the prospect of nuclear disarmament increasingly unrealistic, according to experts. [6]: \\\"We are ready to talk anytime North Korea would like to talk. [7]: We are ready to have the first meeting without preconditions. [8]: Let's just meet,\\\" Tillerson said at a forum in Washington. [9]: William Perry, a former US Defense Secretary who helped broker the 1994 Agreed Framework nuclear deal with the North, said it was \\\"very encouraging news\\\". [10]: \\\"We must find a way to come to the table in order to de-escalate the volatile situation with North Korea,\\\" he tweeted. [11]: What does Donald Trump think? [12]: Trump administration officials have piled pressure on Pyongyang with US-led UN sanctions and talk of a potential pre-emptive attack, with National Security Adviser HR McMaster saying this month the potential for war was \\\"increasing every day\\\". [13]: The president has previously dismissed Tillerson's push for talks with the North, tweeting in October that his top diplomat was \\\"wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man\\\" - his favoured epithet for Kim. [14]: \\\"Save your energy, Rex, we'll do what has to be done!\\\" [15]: he added -- and rumours have swirled in recent weeks that Trump was about to sack him. [16]: Whether Tillerson's words herald a major policy shift by the administration remains to be seen. [17]: White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump's views on the North \\\"have not changed\\\". [18]: The North has long expressed a willingness to talk without preconditions and is likely to respond positively to any such offer, analysts say. [19]: \\\"They have believed that the US would have no choice but to sit down with the North for talks in the end... and they might have been right,\\\" said Chung Sung-Yoon, of the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.\",\n          \"President Trump has responded to players from multiple NFL teams kneeling or locking arms on Sunday, tweeting that taking a knee is not acceptable, and suggested the act of protest will lead to bad ratings for the league?\\uc172 games. [1]: Meanwhile, while one Pittsburgh team did not come out of the locker room for the anthem on Sunday, another has accepted the president's invitation to join him at the White House. [2]: Trump tweeted that the Stanley Cup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins will be joining him at the White House, but did not provide a date. [3]: \\\"Great team!\\\" [4]: he added. [5]: The Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday chose not to participate in the national anthem ceremony at all at Soldier Field in Chicago for their noon game against the Chicago Bears. [6]: Elsewhere, owners from the Atlanta Falcons, Detroit Lions, New York Jets, Miami Dolphins, Philadelphia Eagles and Jacksonville Jaguars have now joined players on the field in solidarity. [7]: One owner, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, criticized Trump, who he has previously called a very good friend, saying he is \\\"deeply disappointed\\\" in the president?\\uc172 comments condemning NFL players who kneel in protest during the national ant [8]: \\\"There is no greater unifier in this country than sports, and unfortunately, nothing more divisive than politics,\\\" Kraft said in a statement tweeted by the Patriots [9]: \\\"I think our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and the importance of working together toward a common goal,\\\" the statement said. [10]: \\\"Our players are intelligent, thoughtful, and care deeply about our community and I support their right to peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is impactful.\\\" [11]: The public disagreement comes only months after the Patriots made a formal visit to the White House in April during which Kraft called Trump a \\\"very good friend.\\\" [12]: Kraft's comments came shortly after Trump early on Sunday morning turned his attention to NFL fans in his feud with the league over players who kneel in protest during the national anthem, saying many people \\\"stay away\\\" from the games \\\"because they  [13]: The president also suggested that if fans refuse to go to games due to the protests, \\\"you will see change fast.\\\" [14]: Trump's tweets Sunday came just a couple of hours before a series of NFL games scheduled for the day begin. [15]: Earlier, on Saturday night, the president slammed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for speaking out against Trump's condemnation of kneeling players and statement that team owners should fire those players. [16]: Goodell is \\\"trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country,\\\" Trump tweeted [17]: \\\"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.\\\" [18]: NFL players across the league and their union -- and even some team officials -- were more direct in their response to Trump's criticism Friday night of the handful of NFL players who have kneeled or sat on the bench during the national anthem perfo [19]: The practice was most famously done by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.\",\n          \"If any doubts remain about the veracity of ESPN anchor Jemele Hill's assessment of Donald Trump, the president spent Friday night and much of Saturday morning lashing out at black athletes-because said attacks play straight to his white nationalist b [1]: On Friday, while stumping in Alabama for GOP senate candidate Luther Strange, Trump diverted from his prepared remarks, as is his wont. [2]: After a lengthy pause, Trump stared grimly into the distance, and then unleashed a winding, unhinged spiel about NFL players who kneeled during the National Anthem. [3]: He asked the assembled crowd, \\\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'get that son of a bitch off the field right now. [4]: He's fired.'\\\" [5]: The audience cheered. [6]: Trump didn't stop there, waxing nostalgic about the NFL of yore, when men-real men-could inflict permanent damage on one another without worrying about those pesky concussive and subconcussive blows to the head and long-term cognitive diseases, sound [7]: \\\"They're ruining the game!\\\" [8]: he whinged. [9]: Trump added that ratings had dropped, partly because fans preferred to watch him, and encouraging anyone who witnesses the free expression of political thought should flee to a preferred safe space and boycott the NFL altogether. [10]: \\\"I guarantee things will stop,\\\" he said. [11]: \\\"Just pick up and leave. [12]: Pick up and leave. [13]: Not the same game anymore, anyway.\\\" [14]: Trump's anti-NFL comments in Huntsville were just the beginning. [15]: On Saturday morning, shortly following a Fox & Friends segment on the Golden State Warriors' star, Stephen Curry. [16]: Specifically, Trump did not fancy Curry's announcement that he had no desire to be feted by the White House, and so Trump tweeted that he never wanted Curry and the rest of those mean ol' world champion Golden State Warriors to come to his party any [17]: Granted, as LeBron James helpfully pointed out, Curry wasn't \\\"hesitating.\\\" [18]: He said outright that he had no intention of serving as Trump's grinning prop. [19]: Also, the insult \\\"bum\\\" has been dragged back into the lexicon, which is nice, given that it will probably irk Trump as much as any other (accurate) label.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id_event\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          4,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label_bias_0-2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          2,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
